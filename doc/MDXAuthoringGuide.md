# MDX Content Authoring Guide

This document establishes the standards for creating and editing content pages (`.mdx`) in **TheHouseOfPhi**.

## 1. File Structure

Every content page must start with the **Frontmatter** block (the section between `---`).

```mdx
---
layout: ../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro
title: Page Title - The House of Phi
lang: en
---
import VectorCanvas from '../../components/VectorCanvas.astro';
import * as math from 'mathjs';

<!-- Content begins here -->
```

## 2. Content Organization

### 2.1. HTML vs. Markdown
Although MDX supports HTML tags (`<article>`, `<section>`), we prefer **standard Markdown** for the body content to maintain readability and portability.

| Element | Preferred Syntax | HTML Equivalent (Avoid if possible) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Headers** | `# Title`, `## Subtitle` | `<h1>`, `<h2>` |
| **Paragraphs** | Just text separated by empty lines | `<p>` |
| **Lists** | `- Item` or `1. Item` | `<ul>`, `<ol>` |
| **Emphasis** | `**bold**`, `*italic*` | `<strong>`, `<em>` |

### 2.2. Semantic Wrappers
You may use HTML tags when you need specific styling hooks (CSS classes) or semantic grouping that Markdown cannot provide.

*   **`<article>`**: It is recommended to wrap the main content if the Layout does not already do so.
*   **`<div>` or `<section>`**: Use sparingly, mainly for layout control (e.g., columns).

### 2.3. Header Numbering

Headers must be numbered manually according to the following hierarchy:

*   **Level 1 (`#`):** Used only once per file as the document title. This header is **not** numbered.
*   **Level 2 (`##`):** Numbered sequentially starting from 1 (e.g., `1. Section`, `2. Section`).
*   **Level 3 (`###`):** Displays the parent Level 2 number, followed by a dot, and then a sequential number starting from 1. The counter resets when the Level 2 section changes (e.g., `1.1. Subsection`, `1.2. Subsection`).

**Usage Example:**

```md
# Main Page Title

## 1. Introduction
...

### 1.1. Context
...

## 2. Methodology
```
### 2.4. Standard Chapter Structure

Every chapter (MDX file) must begin with an Introduction section (## 1. Introduction). This section serves three purposes:
* 1. Motivation: Provide a general overview and motivate the reader about the content. 
* 2. Navigation: List the main blocks or sections of the chapter. 
* 3. Planning: If the chapter is a work in progress, list the planned sections to outline the structure.

**Format:**
The introduction should end with a list of the chapter's sections, including internal links to them (anchors). If a section does not exist yet, include the link to its planned anchor name. 

**Example:**
```md 
## 1. Introduction
Physics and geometry are inseparable... [Motivational text] 
### 1.1. Chapter Overview 
This resource is organized into the following blocks: 
- **[Triangle Geometry](#2-triangle-geometry):** Basic properties and fundamental theorems. 
- **[Trigonometric Ratios](#3-trigonometric-ratios):** Definitions and applications. 
```

## 3. Mathematical Expressions

We use **KaTeX** for fast, client-side math rendering. The styles are globally included in `BaseLayout.astro`, ensuring consistent rendering across all pages.

### 3.1. Syntax

#### Inline Math
Use single dollar signs (`$`) to include math within a sentence.

**Source:**
```md
The velocity vector is defined as $\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$.
```

**Rendered:**
The velocity vector is defined as $\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$.

#### Block Math (Display Mode)
Use double dollar signs (`$$`) to display equations on their own line, centered. **Important:** Place the `$$` delimiters on separate lines from the equation content to ensure proper rendering and support for numbering tags.

**Source:**
    ```md
    $$
    \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
    $$
    ```

**Rendered:**
$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

### 3.2. Numbered Equations

Use `\eqtag{}` inside the LaTeX block. The system automatically adds brackets `[]` around the number.

```md
$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \eqtag{5.1}
$$
```

## 4. Graphics and Figures

We use standard Markdown syntax for both static and dynamic images. The build process automatically converts them into `<figure>` elements with captions.

**Caption & Numbering:**
The text inside the square brackets `[]` (alt text) is used as the figure caption. It must follow the numbering format `X.Y`, where:
*   **X**: The number of the current Level 2 section (`##`).
*   **Y**: A sequential number starting at 1, which resets for each new Level 2 section.

### 4.1. Static Images
For standard image files (SVG, PNG, JPG), simply use the relative path to the file in the `public/` directory.

**Syntax:**
```md
![Figure X.Y: Caption text](/path/to/source)
```

### 4.2. Dynamic Graphics (VectorCanvas)
For geometric constructions generated by code (using `CartesianPlane` or `EuclideanSpace`), use standard Markdown image syntax with the `vector:` protocol.

#### 1. Define the Logic (JavaScript)
Create a function in the corresponding page script (e.g., `src/scripts/pages/geometryPage.js`) inside the exported dictionary.

```js
import { CartesianPlane } from '/src/scripts/core/CartesianPlane.js';

export const geometryDrawings = {
    "mySvgId": (svg) => {
        // 2D Example
        const plane = new CartesianPlane(svg, -5, 5, -5, 5);
        plane.drawVector([0,0], [3,2], "v");
        plane.drawAxes("y", "x", "O");
    },
    "anotherSvgId": (svg) => {
        // 3D Example (EuclideanSpace)
        // ...
    }
};
```

**Best Practices for Scripts:**
*   **Do not** manipulate the DOM directly (e.g., `document.createElement`). Use the provided classes.
*   **Do not** call `transformCoordinates()` manually. The engines handle this.
*   **Do not** set SVG width/height manually. The `VectorCanvas` component handles sizing.

**Math in Graphics:**
You can render LaTeX expressions inside the SVG using `drawMath`.
*   **Requirement:** The MDX page must load the MathJax script.
    ```html
    <script id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-svg.js"></script>
    ```

#### 2. Insert the Graphic (MDX)
Use the `vector:` protocol followed by the ID defined in your page script.

```md
![Figure X.Y: Description of the graphic](vector:mySvgId)
```

Where:
*   **X**: The number of the current Level 2 section (`##`).
*   **Y**: A sequential number starting at 1, which resets for each new Level 2 section.

## 5. Computed Values and Solved Exercises

For exercises where values are calculated and displayed dynamically, we use a strategy that mixes JavaScript logic with MDX content. This ensures accuracy and consistency.

### 5.1. Defining Logic (MDX)
Place your calculation logic inside the MDX file, before the specific exercise. Use `export const` to ensure variables are accessible in the template.

```js
import * as math from 'mathjs';

// Define constants and calculations
export const vRiver = [9, 0];
export const vBoat = [0, 36];
export const vResult = math.add(vRiver, vBoat);
```

**Step 2: Usage in Content**
You can use curly braces `{}` to output the value.

```md
Given a circle with radius {radius} m, the area is:

$ A = \pi r^2 =$ {area.toFixed(2)} $\text{ m}^2 $
```
**Important**: Variable interpolation {} only works when interleaved with inline math ($) or plain text. It does not work inside block math ($$).

### 5.2. Contextual Linking in Solutions
When writing the solution for an exercise, explicitly reference the theoretical concepts explained earlier in the document that are being applied. Use internal links to the corresponding sections (anchors) to reinforce learning.

**Example:**
```md
On the other hand, the speed of the boat $\vec v_b$ can be expressed as a [sum of vectors](#3-sum-of-vectors-graphical-method):
```

## 6. Navigation

While global navigation should be handled by the Layout, local navigation (Table of Contents) or breadcrumbs can be added manually or via components.

```html
<nav>
    [Home](/) > [Geometry](./geometry)
</nav>
```

## 7. Cross-Referencing

To maintain clarity and navigability, it's important to reference other parts of the document correctly.

### 7.1. Referencing Sections (Native)

Headings in MDX automatically generate `id` attributes based on their text (converted to kebab-case). You can link to them using standard Markdown links.

**Source:**
```md
As seen in [File Structure](#1-file-structure), the frontmatter is required.
```

### 7.2. Referencing Equations

We do not use hyperlinks for equations. Instead, we use visual numbering and manual text references.

**1. Numbering Convention**
The content of `\tag{}` must follow the format `X.Y`, where:
*   **X**: The number of the current Level 2 section (`##`).
*   **Y**: A sequential number starting at 1, which resets for each new Level 2 section.

**2. Definition**
Use `\tag{}` inside the LaTeX block.

```md
$$
\vec{p} = m \cdot \vec{v} \tag{2.1}
$$
```

**3. Reference**
Simply write the number, between brackets `[]`, in the text.

```md
Substituting the velocity value into equation [2.1], we obtain...
```
```
