            <section><h3>1.1 Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    A body moves when over time it changes position relative to a reference point that is assumed to be fixed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this article, dedicated to <strong>kinematics</strong>, we study the movement of physical bodies without considering the causes that produce it. This objective will be achieved when we know at each instant where the moving body is located and how it moves. We must therefore obtain an equation that relates the position of the body to time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To reduce complexity and focus on the basic concepts of kinematics, instead of studying the motion of any body, we will begin by studying the motion of a <strong>material point</strong>; with which we sometimes roughly represent a body. And we define it as a geometric point in which we consider that all the mass of the body is concentrated.
                </p>

            <section><h3> 1.2 Movement and trajectory</h3>
                <p>
                    To determine the position of a material point, it is necessary to specify the <strong>coordinate system</strong> relative to which its position is measured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The position of a point, relative to the chosen reference system, is described by the <strong>position vector \(\vec r\)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To study the motion of the material point, we will analyze how the position vector \(\vec r\) varies over time. Thus, we will seek to determine the vector function \(\vec r(t)\), which describes how each of its components varies with time (t).
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">\( \vec r(t) = x(t)\vec i + y(t)\vec j + z(t)\vec k = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) \)</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.1]">[1.1]</div>
                </div>
                <figure class="centered">
                    <svg id="svg1_1"></svg >
                    <figcaption><b>Figure 1.1</b> Position vector \(\vec r\), indicating the position of the material point at a given instant and with respect to a given coordinate system.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The end of the position vector \(\vec r\) draws a line in space described by the material point in its movement. This route or path that the moving point follows over time is called a <strong>trajectory</strong>. We can imagine the trajectory as a line that marks the exact path of the object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we know the trajectory of the moving point (for example, a straight line, a circle, etc.), then the problem of describing its motion is greatly simplified. All we need to find is an equation that tells us at what point of that trajectory the object is at each instant of time. If we call s the path traveled, the kinematic problem is therefore reduced to knowing s = f(t).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, imagine a ball falling in a straight line. The trajectory is a vertical line. If we find an equation s = f(t), which tells us how high the ball is at each second, then we have solved the kinematic problem for that ball.
                </p>

            <section><h3>1.3 Displacement Vector</h3>
                <p>
                    The instant at which the study of the motion of a material point begins is called the <strong>initial instant</strong> \(t_0\). The position of the point at that instant is the <strong>initial position</strong> \(\vec r_0\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the temporal reference system, like the spatial reference instant, is arbitrary, we consider \(t_0\) = 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As time goes by, the moving body will change position. At time \(t_1\), its position will be \(\vec r(t_1)\), at time \(t_2\), it will be \(\vec r(t_2)\) and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, to represent the change in position of the material point, we define the <strong>displacement vector</strong> \(\Delta \vec r\) in the time interval [\(t_1\), \(t_2\)] as a vector whose origin is the position of the point at the instant \(t_1\) and whose end is the position at the instant \(t_2\).
                </p>
                <p>Thus,</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">\(\Delta\vec r = \vec r(t_2) - \vec r(t_1)\)</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.2]">[1.2]</div>
                </div>
                <p>If we call \(\Delta t\) the elapsed time interval, we can write</p>
                <p>&emsp; \(t_1 = t\)</p>
                <p>&emsp; \(t_2 = t + \Delta t\)</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">\(\Delta\vec r = \vec r(t + \Delta t) - \vec r(t)\)</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.3]">[1.3]</div>
                </div>
                <p>which can also be expressed as</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">\(\Delta\vec r = \Delta x\vec i + \Delta y\vec j + \Delta z\vec k\)</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.4]">[1.4]</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    where \(\Delta x\), \(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta z\) represents how the coordinates of the point vary in the time interval considered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the body moves in a straight line, and without changing the direction of its movement, the magnitude of the displacement vector coincides with the distance traveled by the body. However, this only applies in these circumstances, because the displacement vector does not depend on the path followed by the object, only on the initial and final points.
                </p>

            <section><h3>1.4 Velocity</h3>
                <p>
                    We said in the Introduction that in the study of the motion of a point we are interested in knowing where it is and how it moves at each instant. We achieve the first objective by knowing the temporal variation of the position vector \(\vec r\), and to know how it moves, that is, what will happen to the moving point in successive instants, we introduce a new magnitude called <strong>velocity</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose that a certain material point P moves in a time interval \(\Delta t\) from a point 1 to a point 2. Characterized respectively by the position vectors \(\vec r_1\) and \(\vec r_2\).
                </p>

                    <figcaption><b>Figura 1.3</b> Position vectors \(\vec r_ 1\) and \(\vec r_ 2\), displacement vector \(\vec \Delta r\) and velocity vectors \(\vec v_1\) and \(\vec v_2\) of a moving object</figcaption>

                <p>
                    The <strong>average velocity</strong> \(\vec v_{avg}\) in the time interval \(\Delta t\) is defined as:
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \vec v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec r}{\Delta t} $$</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.5]">[1.5]</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The <strong>instantaneous velocity</strong> \(\vec v\) is defined as:
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \vec v = \lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec r}{\Delta t} = \frac{d \vec r}{d t} $$</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.6]">[1.6]</div>
                </div>
                <p>That is, as the speed of change of the position vector \(\vec r\) with respect to time.</p>
                <p>This vector is tangent to the path and its direction is that of movement.</p>
                <p>
                    If we refer the instantaneous velocity to the path traveled, or the length of the path, the instantaneous velocity can be expresed in the following way:
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \vec v = \lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec r}{\Delta t} = \lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec r}{\Delta s}\cdot \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} = \lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec r}{\Delta s}\cdot \lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} $$</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.7]">[1.7]</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To each displacement vector \(\Delta \vec r\) corresponds an interval of the path length \(\Delta s\), for each time interval \(\Delta t\). Normally, \(\Delta s > \vert \Delta \vec r \vert \), but when considering time intervals \(\Delta t\) that tend to zero, both values ​​tend to coincide. That is, if \(\Delta t \to 0\), the arc \(\Delta s \to \) the chord \(\vert \Delta \vec r \vert \). And the first limit will be a vector of unit module, tangent to the path and in the direction of the movement. Vector that we will symbolize by \(\vec \tau\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second limit is a scalar and represents the module of the instantaneous velocity \(\vert \vec r \vert\), it is called <strong>celerity</strong> and is represented by \(v\).
                </p>
                <p>So,</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \vec v = v\cdot \vec\tau $$</div>

                <p>
                    If we refer the instantaneous velocity to the components of the position vector, we can express the instantaneous velocity as follows:

            <section><h3>1.5 Acceleration</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Acceleration</strong>, in general, is the variation in speed over a time interval. Since speed is a vector magnitude, acceleration will be different from zero whenever the speed varies in its magnitude, direction or sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To determine the motion of a particle, it is necessary to know how the acceleration changes over time. To do this, we introduce the concepts of average acceleration and instantaneous acceleration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>average acceleration</strong> represents how the speed varies in each unit of time, or the vector that results from dividing the speed variation in a given time interval by said interval.
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \vec a = \frac{\Delta\vec v}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t}\vec i +  \frac{\Delta v_y}{\Delta t}\vec j +  \frac{\Delta v_z}{\Delta t}\vec k $$</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.12]">[1.12]</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The <strong>instantaneous acceleration</strong> is the acceleration that the particle has at any instant \(t\), or at any point in the trajectory. Thus, we can express the instantaneous acceleration as the limit value of the average acceleration when the time interval tends to zero.
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \vec a = \lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec v}{\Delta t} = \frac{d \vec v}{d t} = \frac{d^2 \vec r}{d t^2} $$</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.13]">[1.13]</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Average acceleration has little practical value. Whereas instantaneous acceleration is of great importance. Therefore, from now on, we will always refer to instantaneous acceleration when we talk about acceleration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we know the function that expresses the position vector as a function of time \(\vec r = f(t)\), we can express the <strong>Cartesian components of acceleration</strong> as:
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \vec a = \frac{d \vec v}{d t} = \frac{d (v_x\vec i + v_y\vec j + v_z\vec k)}{d t} = \frac{dv_x}{dt}\vec i + \frac{dv_y}{dt}\vec j + \frac{dv_z}{dt}\vec k = a_x\vec i + a_y\vec j + a_z\vec k $$</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.14]">[1.14]</div>
                </div>
                <p>The <strong>acceleration module</strong> will then be:</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \vert \vec a\vert = \sqrt{a_x^2+a_y^2+a_z^2} $$</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.15]">[1.15]</div>
                </div>
                <p>If we know the curve that defines the particle's trajectory and its path traveled as a function of time \(s=f(t)\), we can express the variation in speed \(\Delta \vec v\) between two points on the trajectory, \(P_1\) and \(P_2\), where the particle's speed is \(\vec v_1\) and \(\vec v_2\) respectively, by means of the composition of two vectors: one in the direction of \(\vec v_1\) and another perpendicular to \(\vec v_1\). Then, the variation in speed would be:</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \Delta \vec v = \Delta\vec v_{\tau} + \Delta\vec v_{\mu}  $$</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.16]">[1.16]</div>
                </div>
                <p>The average acceleration would be:</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \frac{\Delta \vec v}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta\vec v_{\tau}}{\Delta t} + \frac{\Delta\vec v_{\mu}}{\Delta t}  $$</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.17]">[1.17]</div>
                </div>
                <p>And the instantaneous acceleration would be:</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$ \vec a = \lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec v}{\Delta t} = \lim_{\Delta t\to 0}\frac{\Delta\vec v_{\tau}}{\Delta t} + \lim_{\Delta t\to 0}\frac{\Delta\vec v_{\mu}}{\Delta t} = \vec a_{\tau} + \vec a_{\mu} = a_{\tau}\vec {\tau} + a_{\mu}\vec {\mu} $$</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.18]">[1.18]</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Then, the instantaneous acceleration can be expressed by the <strong>intrinsic components of acceleration</strong> as the sum of two accelerations, one in the direction tangent to the trajectory (<strong>tangential acceleration</strong>) and the other in the direction normal to the trajectory (<strong>normal acceleration</strong>) at each point of said trajectory.
