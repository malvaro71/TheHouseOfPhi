                <p>
                    In this first chapter, we examine the concepts of vector, the Cartesian coordinate system and the main vector operations, which are key mathematical tools for dealing with vectors in more than one dimension.

                <p>
                    A <strong>vector</strong>is a directed segment, one end of which (the point A) is said to be the origin, while the other (the point B) is said to be the end of the vector. Such a vector may be denoted by <b><i>v</i></b>,  \(\vec v\) or \(\overrightarrow{AB}\). A vector whose origin and end coincide is said to be a <strong>zero vector</strong>, and is usually denoted by  \(\vec0\). The vector \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) is said to be the vector <strong>opposite</strong> to \(\overrightarrow{AB}\). A vector with length equal to one is called a <strong>unit vector</strong>. Any direction may be assigned to a zero vector.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    The vector origin is also named initial point or point of application. 
                </p>

                    A geometric vector, as defined above, is also called a <strong>fixed vector</strong> or <strong>bound vector</strong>. Because it has a unique initial point. In physics is used, for example, to specify the action of the force on deformable or non rigid body. In this instance, the forces and deformations within the body depend on the point of application of the force, as well as on the  magnitude and line of action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A class of equal vectors lying on the same straight line is said to be a <strong>sliding vector</strong>. An example of sliding vector is the action of a force on a rigid body. So, in this case, the point of application can be moved along the line determined by the vector direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If vectors are only characterized by magnitude and direction, then are called <strong>free vectors</strong>. Examples of free vectors in physics are displacement, velocity and magnetic or electric field strength. In these cases, the vector can be moved to any point in the space
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vector calculus, which is the study of operations performed on vectors, is based on free vectors, since two given free vectors are equivalent to a given sliding vector or a given bound vector, as long as we keep in mind the physical meaning of the vector under analysis. From now on, <strong>we'll talk about free vectors if not mentioned otherwise</strong>.

                <p>
                    The sum of two vectors \(\vec a\) and \(\vec b\), or vector addition, produces a third vector \(\overrightarrow{a+b}\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find \(\overrightarrow{a+b}\), we first draw the vector \(vec a\), and from the terminal end of \(vec a\), we draw the vector \(vec b\). In other words, we have the initial point of \(vec b\) meet the terminal end of \(vec a\). This position corresponds to the notion that we move along the first vector and then, from its terminal point, we move along the second vector. Vector addition has the conmutative property; so, if we first draw vector \(vec b\), and from the terminal end of \(vec b\), we draw the vector \(vec a\), we will obtain \(\overrightarrow{b+a}\), that is equal to \(\overrightarrow{a+b}\).

                    A <strong>scalar</strong> is a quantity that has magnitude but no direction. Or, in other words, a quantity that can be expressed by one (real) number.

            <section><h3>1.4 Cartesian coordinate System</h3>               
                <p>
                    To specify the magnitude and direction of a vector we need a coordinate system. There are three commonly used coordinate systems: Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical.
                    In this section we describe the Cartesian coordinate system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <strong>Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions</strong> is defined by an ordered pair of
                    perpendicular lines (axes), a single unit of length for both axes, and an orientation for each axis. The point where the axes meet is taken as the origin for both, thus turning each axis into a number line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For any point P, a line is drawn through P perpendicular to each axis, and the position where it meetsthe axis is interpreted as a number. The two numbers, in that chosen order, are the Cartesian coordinates (x, y) of P.
                </p>

                    A <strong>Cartesian coordinate system in three dimensions</strong> consists of three perpendicular axes: the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis that go through a common point (the origin <b>0</b>). Because each axis is a number line representing all real numbers in \(\Bbb R\) , the three-dimensional system is often denoted by \(\Bbb R^3\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cartesian coordinate system is also called a <strong>rectangular coordinate system</strong> or <strong>orthogonal coordinate system</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Figure 1.4(a), the positive z-axis is shown above the plane containing the x- and y-axes. The system displayed follows the right-hand rule. If we take our right hand and align the fingers with the positive x-axis, then curl the fingers so they point in the direction of the positive y-axis, our thumb points in the direction of the positive z-axis. In this website, we always work with coordinate systems set up in accordance with the right-hand rule. Some systems do follow a left-hand rule, but the right-hand rule is considered the standard representation.

                <p>
                    We describe a point P in the three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system with the coordinates \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\). Each coordinate describes how the point aligns with
                    the corresponding axis.

                    When the initial point of a vector coincides with the origin of the coordinate system, we call the vector a <strong>standard-position vector</strong>. Because the initial point of any vector in standard position is known to be (0,0), we can describe the vector by looking only at the coordinates of its terminal point. Thus, if vector \(vec v\) has its initial point at the origin and its terminal point at (x, y), we write the vector in component form as

                    When a vector is written in component form like this, the scalars x and y are called the
                    <strong>components</strong> of \(vec v\). When we need to perform calculations with vectors, we usually describe them as standard-position vectors because it is easier to perform such calculations.

                <p>
                    The <strong>scalar product</strong> (also known as the <strong>dot product</strong>) of two vectors is a number (scalar) that is obtained by multiplying the corresponding components of the two vectors and then adding those products.

                <p>
                    If \(\vec v = (x_1, y_1, z_1)\) and \(\vec w = (x_2, y_2, z_2)\) are two vectors, then their scalar product is calculated as follows:

                    The <strong>projection of \(\vec w\)</strong> onto \(\vec v\) or onto the line that contains \(\vec v\), denoted as \(proj_v \vec w\), is a vector that lies on \(\vec v\) and has a direction same as \(\vec v\) (if the angle between \(\vec v\) and \(\vec w\) is less than 90 degrees) or opposite to \(\vec v\) (if the angle between \(\vec v\) and \(\vec w\) is more than 90 degrees).

                    From the definition of <a href="geometry.html#[2.3]" target="_blank"> cosine</a> it follows that the magnitude of this projection vector can be calculated as:

                    Now, if we consider the expression [1.12] for the dot product of \(\vec v\) and \(\vec w\), the magnitude of \(proj_v \vec w\) can also be expressed as:

                <p>
                    The <strong>cross product</strong>, or <strong>vector product</strong>, is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space. It is written as <strong>\(\vec v \times \vec w\)</strong>. The result of the cross product is a vector that is perpendicular (or orthogonal) to the vectors being multiplied or said in other way, normal to the plane containing them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The direction of the cross product is determined by the right-hand rule. If you point your index finger in the direction of \(\vec v\), and your middle finger in the direction of \(\vec w\), your thumb points in the direction of (\vec v \times \vec w\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If \(\vec v\) and \(\vec w\) are two vectors, and Œ∏ is the angle between them, the magnitude of their cross product is given by:  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then, the magnitude (or length) of the cross product can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram that the vectors span.

                    The position vector, \(\vec r\), extends from the point of interest P to the origin of \(\vec v\).

                    The properties of the cross product allow us to conclude that \(\vec M\) is a vector perpendicular to the plane defined by \(\vec r\) and \(\vec v\) and it doesn't change if we move the sliding vector \(\vec v\) along its line of action. This is because the moment of a sliding vector is a measure of its tendency to cause rotation about a point or axis, which is determined by both the vector‚Äôs magnitude and its distance from the point or axis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you slide a vector along its line of action, you‚Äôre not changing the sliding vector‚Äôs magnitude or the perpendicular distance from its line of action to the point or axis of interest. Therefore, the moment remains the same. This property is what makes it a ‚Äúsliding vector‚Äù.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This concept is fundamental in physics and engineering, as it helps us understand and calculate the effects of forces on the rotation of objects.

                <p>
                    A <strong>vector-valued function</strong>, also referred to as a <strong>vector function</strong>, is a mathematical function of one or more variables whose range is a set of vectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, a common type of vector-valued function is one that depends on a single real parameter t and produces a vector \(\vec f(t)\) as the result. In terms of the standard unit vectors \(\vec i\), \(\vec j\), \(\vec k\) of Cartesian 3D-space, these specific types of vector-valued functions are given by expressions such as:
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">\(\vec f(t) = f_x(t)\vec i + f_y(t)\vec j + f_z(t)\vec k\)</div>
                    <div  class="right" id="[1.25]">[1.25]</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Where \(f_x(t)\), \(f_y(t)\), and \(f_z(t)\) are the <strong>coordinate functions</strong> of the parameter t, and the domain of this vector-valued function is the intersection of the domains of the functions \(f_x(t)\), \(f_y(t)\), and \(f_z(t)\).

            <section><h3>1.16 Derivative of a vector-valued function</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>derivative of a vector-valued function</strong> is nearly identical to the definition of derivative of a real-valued function of one variable. However, because the range of a vector-valued function consists of vectors, the same is true for the range of the derivative of a vector-valued function. That is:
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$\vec f'(t) = \frac{d\vec f}{dt} = \frac{df_x}{dt}\vec i + \frac{df_y}{dt}\vec j +\frac{df_z}{dt}\vec k$$</div>

            <section><h3>1.17 Partial derivative of a function and its Total derivative.</h3>
                <p>
                    If a function depends of more than one variable, its <strong>partial derivative</strong> is the derivative with respect to one of those variables, keeping the others as constants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The partial derivative of a function \(f(x,y,z)\) respect of one variable, x, is represented as:
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center"> $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$$</div>

                </div>
                <p>
                    The <strong>total derivative</strong> of the function \(f(x,y,z)\) can be calculated using the expression:
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div  class="center">$$df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz$$</div>

                <p>
                    To find the <strong>integral of a vector-valued function</strong>, we usually split it into its components and integrate each component separately. That is, if  \(\vec f(t) = f_x(t)\vec i + f_y(t)\vec j + f_z(t)\vec k = (f_x(t), f_y(t), f_z(t)) \), its integral is:

            <section><h3>Exercise 1</h3>
                <p>
                    A boatman is rowing on the boat, wanting to always stay perpendicular to the river bank and crossing with an average speed of <span id="2_1avgSpeed"></span> km/h. The river water flows with a speed of <span id="2_1riverSpeed"></span> km/h. How fast should the boat be propelled? In what direction?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The velocity of the boat \(\vec v_b\) is the sum of the velocity with which the boat \(\vec v_p\) is propelled by the boatman plus the velocity of the river water \(\vec v_r\). Then:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp; \(\vec v_p = \vec v_b - \vec v_r \),
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we choose the coordinate plane so that the x-axis has the same direction as the river, the vector components are:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp; \(\vec v_b\) = (<span id="2_1vBoat"></span>) Km/h,
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp; \(\vec v_r\) = (<span id="2_1vRiver"></span>) Km/h,
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp; \(\vec v_p\) = (<span id="2_1vBoat1"></span>) - (<span id="2_1vRiver1"></span>) = (<span id="2_1vPropelled"></span>) Km/h,
                </p>
                <p>
                    The magnitude of the vector \(\vec v_p\) is the speed at which the boat is propelled, is expressed as \(\Vert\vec v_p\Vert\) and, according to <a href="#[1.2]">[1.2]</a>, is calculated as:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp; \(\Vert\vec v_p\Vert = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \sqrt{9^2 + 36^2} = \sqrt{81+1296} = \sqrt {1377}\) = <span id="2_1normvPropelled"></span> Km/h.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The value of the angle &phi; is the direction in which the boat is propelled, corresponds to the orientation of \(\vec v_p\) and according to <a href="#[1.13]">[1.13]</a>, is calculated as:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp; $$\phi = \arccos\frac{\Vert\vec v_p\Vert\cdot\Vert\vec v_r\Vert}{\vec v_p\cdot\vec v_r}$$ 
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp; &phi; = <span style="display: inline;" id="2_1phi1"></span>¬∫
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, the answer to the exercise is that the boat must be propeled at a speed of <span id="2_1normvPropelled1"></span> Km/h and in a direction that forms <span style="display: inline;" id="2_1phi2"></span>¬∫ with the river.

                    A sailboat is moving with a speed of <span id="2_3sailboatSpeed"></span> km/h in the NNE (north-northeast) direction. What are the components of the speed of the ship in the North direction and in the East direction?

                <p>
                    If we place the x-axis in the easterly direction and the y-axis in the north direction, the NNE (north-northeast) direction forms an angle of 67.5¬∫, or 3&pi;/8 radians, with the east; as shown in the figure below.

                    Then, to calculate the value of the component \(\vec V_x\) of \(\vec V\) we use the expresion <a href="#[1.4]">[1.4]</a> and to calculate the value of \(\vec V_y\) we use the expresion <a href="#[1.5]">[1.5]</a>. With \(\Vert\vec V\Vert\) = 4 km/h and &theta; = 67.5¬∫`.

                <p>
                    An object moves in such a way that its speed at a certain instant is <span id="2_4Speed1"></span> m/s and forms an angle of <span id="2_4orientation1"></span>¬∫ with the horizontal.

                    The formulas to calculate the components of a vector \(\vec v\) given its magnitude \(\Vert\vec v\Vert\) and direction &theta; are given by the expresions <a href="#[1.4]">[1.4]</a> and <a href="#[1.5]">[1.5]</a>:

                <p>&emsp; \(\vec v_x = 120\cos30¬∫ = 120\cdot\sqrt3/2\)  = <span id="2_4Vx1"></span> m/s </p>

                <p>And</p>
                <p>&emsp; \(\vec v\) = <span id="2_4Vx2"></span>\(\cdot\vec i\) + <span id="2_4Vy2"></span>\(\cdot\vec j\) m/s</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    To solve this exercise, we use the concept of <a href="#Vector cross product">vector cross product</a> and the expression<a href="#[1.18]">[1.18]</a>. Since the magnitude (or length) of the vector cross product can be interpreted as the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe parallelogram spanned by the two vectors being multiplied, then the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtriangle \(\triangle ABC\) would be half the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsaid parallelogram.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we define the vector \(\vec{AB}\) as the one that goes from point A to point B, and the vector \(\vec{AC}\) as the one that goes from point A to point C, and we calculate their coordinates.

                <p>And we calculate the area of ‚Äã \(\triangle\)ABC using the following expression:</p>
                <p>$$\frac{\Vert\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}\Vert}{2}$$</p>
                <p>Resulting in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã\(\triangle\)ABC being <span id="2_8area"></span> \(m^2\).</p>
